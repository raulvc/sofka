# sofka

A Kubernetes TUI written in Rust, on [`kube-rs`](https://kube.rs) and
[`ratatui`](https://ratatui.rs). Async everywhere, so the UI never blocks on the
cluster.

**[sofka.rs](https://sofka.rs)** - the website, with a watchable tour of a real
session ([sofka.rs/#play](https://sofka.rs/#play)).

[![A one-minute sofka session: filtering to a crashloop, explaining why it's broken, following its logs, and inspecting Helm releases](docs/demo.gif)](https://sofka.rs/#play)

## Why "sofka"

<img src="docs/sophie.png" alt="Sophie, a Russian Blue, watching the screen with visible suspicion" align="right" width="220">

That's Sophie, a Russian Blue. She sits behind the monitor and watches the
screen. Constantly, not sometimes. She has the narrow-eyed look of someone who
has seen a pod in `CrashLoopBackOff`. She catches every state change and doesn't
get distracted. She is, in effect, a cluster watchman that is a cat.

`sofka` is the Serbian short form of Sophia, which means "wisdom". A good cluster
TUI and a good cat both watch things closely, and both know when something is
wrong.

<br clear="right">

## What it does

sofka is a Kubernetes terminal interface inspired by
[k9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s). It uses a shared object pipeline. Both
programs support built-in and custom resources. The main functions are:

- **Custom resource browsing** - one generic render pipeline, built-in columns
  for common kinds, NAME/AGE for the rest, and `enter` on a CRD drills into its
  custom resources.
- **Flux CD built in** - `t` suspends, resumes, and reconciles through native API
  patches. No `flux` binary. Plus a native Helm inspector that decodes release
  Secrets itself.
- **Argo CD built in** - `t` suspends, resumes, and syncs ArgoCD Applications.
  ApplicationSets support suspend and resume. These actions use native API
  patches. No `argocd` binary.
- **It tells you why something is broken** - `X` opens a deterministic,
  evidence-based incident view. No AI, no external service.
- **Bulk actions** - `space` marks rows for delete, kill, or Flux actions across
  many resources at once.
- **Port-forwards run in the background** - starting one doesn't freeze the TUI,
  and `:pf` manages them all.
- **Guardrails and read-only mode** - "never delete in prod" is enforced, not
  remembered.
- **Skins** - Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Solarized, Nord, Dracula, Tokyo Night, One
  Dark, Rosé Pine, Rosé Pine Dawn, Monokai, Flexoki, with auto dark/light
  detection.

The [full feature list](docs/features.md) is long. So is the
[comparison with k9s](docs/vs-k9s.md), with shared functions and design differences.

## Installation

Every [release](https://github.com/nklmilojevic/sofka/releases) ships prebuilt
binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows (aarch64/x86_64).
Windows ZIP files contain `sofka.exe` and the license notices.
Linux releases also include DEB, RPM, Arch Linux, and Alpine APK packages.
See [release packages](docs/release-packages.md) for installation and platform limits.

```sh
brew install nklmilojevic/sofka/sofka   # Homebrew (macOS/Linux)
nix run github:nklmilojevic/sofka       # Nix, nothing to install
cargo install sofka                     # Cargo
```

Or build from source: `cargo build --release` (see
[Development](docs/architecture.md#development)).

Use the [Home Manager module](docs/home-manager.md) to install Sofka and manage
its configuration with Nix.

### macOS: "cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified"

The release binaries aren't signed or notarized yet, so Gatekeeper refuses a
tarball you downloaded in a browser. Nothing is broken. Clear the quarantine flag
once:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine sofka
```

(Or right-click the binary in Finder, pick Open, confirm once.)

## Usage

Shell completion is available for Bash, Zsh, Fish, Elvish, and PowerShell.
Run `sofka completion <shell>` and follow the
[setup instructions](docs/shell-completion.md).

```
sofka [RESOURCE] [-n NAMESPACE] [-A] [--context NAME] [--kubeconfig PATH] [--readonly | --write]

  RESOURCE          resource to open (alias/plural/kind), default: pods
  -n, --namespace   namespace to start in
  -A, --all-namespaces
  --context         kubeconfig context to start in (default: current context)
  --kubeconfig      kubeconfig file to use (sets $KUBECONFIG for the session)
  --allow-v1-client-cert  allow X.509 v1 client certificates for this run
  --readonly        disable every mutating action for the session
  --write           force write mode, overriding any config `readonly`
  --experimental-describe  use deskribe for native resource descriptions
```

Use `sofka ctx` or `sofka contexts` to open the context picker before connecting.
Select a context to connect and open its configured default resource, or pods.
`--context NAME` selects the initial context in the picker. An unknown name
returns an error. `-n` and `-A` apply to the first successful selection only. These launch commands
require interactive mode and cannot be used with `--check` or `--snapshot`.

`--readonly` and `--write` set the mode for the whole session and win over the
config `readonly` option, including per-cluster and per-context overrides, on
every `:ctx` switch. With no flag, switching into a context whose config sets
`readonly = true` enables read-only mode (shown as `[read-only]` in the header),
and switching away restores write mode.

Headless modes need no TTY and double as CI smoke tests:

```sh
sofka --check                # connect, run discovery, print a summary, exit
sofka pods --snapshot        # render one frame of a resource view to stdout
sofka dp -A --snapshot       # deployments, all namespaces
sofka info                   # runtime diagnostics: build, config, discovery, latency, dirs
sofka info --offline         # the same report without connecting to a cluster
sofka plugin search          # search the official reviewed plugin catalog
sofka plugin install ID      # install the latest compatible package
sofka plugin update          # explicitly update all managed packages
sofka plugin list            # offline installed-package inventory
```

Native describe is experimental and uses the standalone `deskribe` Rust library.
Enable it with `--experimental-describe` or `[experimental] native_describe = true`
in config to use it for `d`. Kubectl remains the default. See
[configuration](docs/configuration.md#experimental-native-describe).

### Keys

The essentials. `?` in the app shows everything, or see the
[full key reference](docs/keys.md).

## Configuration

Use `config.toml`, `config.yaml`, or `config.yml` under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sofka`
(or `~/.config/sofka`). Keep one file at each config level. All
optional - an empty config behaves like no config. `:reload` re-reads it live.

```toml
default_namespace = "kube-system"
default_resource  = "deployments"
readonly          = false
favorite_namespaces = ["kube-system", "monitoring"]

[aliases]
dep = "deployments"

[skin]
name = "gruvbox-dark"   # omit to auto-detect dark/light
```

Any option can be overridden per cluster or per kubeconfig context, so prod can
be read-only in a light skin while everything else stays as is. See the
[configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) for the rest.
