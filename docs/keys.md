# Key reference

The default keymap. All built-in keyboard actions are configurable.
See [Configure key bindings](keybindings.md) for scopes and action names.
`?` inside sofka shows the effective bindings, including your own
plugin, bookmark, and workspace chords. `:` and `?` work from every navigation
screen; closing either returns to the screen where it was opened. Text-entry
pickers keep both characters available as input.

## Table views

At launch, `sofka ctx` or `sofka contexts` opens the context picker before
connecting. Press Enter to connect to the selected context and open its default
resource, or pods if none is set.

Use `:resource -n namespace --context context /filter` to apply a complete query.
Use `:resource @context [namespace]` for cross-context navigation. Context names
fuzzy-complete after `@`; Tab/Shift-Tab or Down/Up fill the selected context in
the command. Add a namespace if needed, then press Enter to run the query.
Without a namespace, a context switch uses its remembered or default namespace.
This does not change kubeconfig's `current-context`.

Scope options precede the slash. Structured filter terms combine with spaces or
`&&`, with `||` for OR and `!(...)` for group negation. `/` edits the active filter
and Esc clears it. See [filtering](filtering.md)
for the grammar and selector persistence rules.

A normal context switch through `:ctx` keeps the current resource type if the
target cluster supports it. Otherwise, sofka opens that context's configured
default resource, or Pods, and shows a fallback message. Filters and object
ownership scope are cleared. Startup still uses the configured default resource.

Shift+Arrow selects a range in the visible row order. Reversing direction reduces
the range and keeps separate marks made with `space`. Other keys end the range
operation. Normal movement keeps marked rows. Filtering, sorting, view changes,
and changes to the row order reset the range before the next Shift+Arrow press.

## Node drain (`D` on a node)

| Key                           | Action                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Tab` / `Down`                | Select the next option                                    |
| `Shift-Tab` / `Up`            | Select the previous option                                |
| `Space`                       | Toggle the selected checkbox                              |
| Text / `Backspace` / `Ctrl-U` | Edit / remove a character / clear the selected duration   |
| `Enter`                       | Review options, then confirm; close a completed operation |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl-C`              | Cancel the form or active operation; close its result     |
| `PgUp` / `PgDn`               | Scroll the form, confirmation, or progress                |

Drain options apply to the current operation only. The final confirmation shows
all target nodes and selected options. Configured confirmation rules still apply.
During a drain, navigation is disabled. Canceling stops requests and waiting; it
cannot reverse a request that the API has accepted. Nodes remain cordoned.
See [Node drain options](features.md#node-drain-options) for defaults and limits.

## Port-forward picker (`f` on a pod or service)

| Key                  | Action                                                         |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enter`              | start the selected mapping, or open manual input for "Custom…" |
| `e`                  | edit only the local port of a declared mapping                 |
| `x`                  | stop the running forward for the selected mapping (`● ` rows)  |
| `j` / `k`, `↓` / `↑` | select a mapping                                               |
| `PgDn` / `PgUp`      | move one page down / up                                        |
| `esc` / `q`          | close the picker                                               |

The local-port prompt contains the current value. `enter` starts the forward;
`esc` returns to the same picker row. Invalid or unavailable ports keep the
prompt open for correction. If the forward process cannot start, the prompt
keeps the edited value so you can retry.

## PVC explore (`x` on a PVC)

A two-pane file browser over a PersistentVolumeClaim: your local filesystem on
the left, the volume on the right. `s` on a PVC row opens a shell at the mount
point instead. See [PVC explore](features.md#pvc-explore).

| Key              | Action                                                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tab`, `←` / `→` | switch pane (the focused pane has the bright border)                        |
| `j`/`k`, `g`/`G` | move within the focused pane                                                |
| `enter`          | open the selected directory                                                 |
| `⌫` or `-`       | go up one directory - stops at the mount point, never above it              |
| `c`              | copy the selection into the other pane: download from the volume, or upload |
| `s`              | shell into the volume at the directory the remote pane is showing           |
| `r`              | re-read both panes                                                          |
| `esc` / `q`      | close (and delete the helper pod, if one was created)                       |

## Logs view

`/` filter (substring · `/regex/` · `!invert`) · `s`/`f` autoscroll · `w` wrap ·
`J` JSON formatting · `Ctrl+Z` warning/error filter · `m` visual marker · `t` timestamps · `x` stop/resume stream · `z` clear buffer · `c` copy buffer ·
`ctrl-s` save to file · `F` fullscreen (no chrome, clean text selection) ·
`0`–`5` time anchors (tail · 1m · 5m · 15m · 30m · 1h) · `T` custom lookback (`s`/`m`/`h`/`d`, or `tail` for kubelet logs)
(VictoriaLogs views) · `esc` back. The newest line anchors to the bottom of the
viewport.

`t` shows or hides timestamps in the current buffer without restarting the
streams. Log lines keep their timestamp order in both display settings.

`m` adds a separator after the latest received log line. Repeated presses add
separate markers. Markers stay visible through filters and are excluded from
sofka copy/save. While paused, a marker is added at the buffer tail without
moving the viewport. Markers have no timestamp. They are removed when the
buffer is cleared or replaced, or when their position is trimmed. Marker count
is limited to the active log buffer cap. Manual terminal selection can include
visible markers.

## Describe

`d` uses kubectl by default. Enable the experimental `deskribe` backend with
`--experimental-describe` or `[experimental] native_describe = true` in config.
Unsupported native resources use a labeled kubectl fallback; errors from that
fallback never show cached YAML. See
[configuration](configuration.md#experimental-native-describe) for overrides
and reload behavior. Helm rows continue to show release notes.

## Document views (YAML, describe, diff, events)

`ctrl-f` / `ctrl-b` page forward or back, with `PgDn` / `PgUp` as aliases.
`/` searches like vim: the whole document stays on screen and every match is
highlighted. `n` / `N` go to the next or previous match. `w` wraps. `c` copies
the document. `esc` backs out - the first press clears an active search.

`F` toggles fullscreen for document views and plugin popup output. Fullscreen
uses the full terminal area without the application header, status line, key
hints, borders, or scrollbars. The title and active search or command prompt
remain visible. Search, scrolling, wrapping, copying, and refresh still work.
The setting stays on across refreshes and new documents for the current session.
It starts off in a new session and is separate from the Logs fullscreen setting.
`F` restores the normal layout. `esc` and `q` keep their existing behavior.

Automatic refresh is available in these resource views:

| View                           | Automatic refresh           | Other refresh controls                            |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| YAML, decoded Secret, describe | `r` turns refresh on or off | None                                              |
| Diff                           | `r` turns refresh on or off | `R` resets the baseline to the displayed resource |
| Explain                        | `R` turns refresh on or off | `r` refreshes immediately                         |

Automatic refresh is off when a view opens. It reads immediately, then waits
5 seconds after each result before the next read. Describe retains its selected
backend: kubectl by default, or native-first with a labeled kubectl fallback when
opted in. Native describe fetches
fresh resource, related-object, and event data through the current Kubernetes
client. The other views also read through the API. YAML and describe support
custom resources.

Refresh keeps the original resource and context. It preserves document search,
scroll position where possible, and the selected Explain resource when findings
move or its status text changes. Findings without a resource target match by
content. If the selected finding disappears, the selection clears. Select another
finding before opening its resource, events, or logs.
A shorter document can reduce the scroll position. The status indicator shows
`refresh` while automatic refresh is on and `stopped` when it is off. Documents
without refresh support, such as saved snapshots and Helm manifests, show `static`.

Automatic refresh stops when you leave the view, open help or the command
palette, or a request fails. Document search keeps refresh active. A failed
request keeps the last result and shows the reason. A deleted resource, or a
resource recreated with the same name and a different UID, also stops refresh.
Opening events or logs from Explain stops its automatic refresh; returning does
not restart it. Its existing manual evidence request can still finish.

Diff keeps the baseline chosen when the view opens, even if the last-applied
annotation or session history changes. `R` makes the currently displayed object
the new baseline. A Diff view can stay open when both sides match, so automatic
refresh can show later changes. This does not add change highlighting to YAML.

## Help panel (`?`)

`j` / `k` and `↑` / `↓` scroll one line. `ctrl-f`, `PgDn`, and `space` move
forward one page. `ctrl-b` and `PgUp` move back one page. The page size is the
number of visible content rows. `g` / `Home` go to the top; `G` / `End` go to
the bottom.

`/` filters the bindings. Opening help, starting a filter, and clearing a filter
reset the scroll position to the top. `esc` clears an active filter first, then
closes help. `q` or `?` closes help and returns to the previous screen.

## Explain view (`X`)

`j` / `k` move, `⏎` goes to the resource behind a finding (a blocking pod), `E`
its events, `l` its logs, `r` gathers again, `esc` goes back. After opening
logs or events, one `esc` returns to Explain and another returns to the table. A
finding you can drill into has a trailing `→`.

## Adjacent view (`u`)

Every object directly connected to the selection: what owns it, what it owns,
what its spec names (a pod's node, claims, ConfigMaps, Secrets), and what names
it (the pods mounting a claim, the claims using a class). `j` / `k` move, `⏎`
opens the object in its own view - name-filtered, so every action there applies
to it - `y` shows its YAML, `d` describes it, `r` gathers again, `esc` goes back.
Not offered on namespaces (`enter` re-scopes to one) or Helm rows.
See [Views](views.md#navigating-between-kinds) for adding CRD relations.

## Pickers

`PgDn` and `PgUp` move one page through every list picker: contexts,
namespaces, sort and copy fields, port forwards, containers, set image, skins,
snapshots, and the action and transfer menus. The page size is the number of
visible list rows. Paging also works while a picker filter is being typed.

## Text inputs (palette, filters, prompts)

`ctrl-u` clears the line, `ctrl-w` / `alt-⌫` delete the previous word.

## Palette completion keys

In the `:` palette, `tab`/`↓` and `shift-tab`/`↑` move through the suggestion
list, `→` fills the highlighted one into the command so you can keep typing,
and `⏎` runs the highlighted one. `→` replaces only the word it completes: the
resource or command name, or the namespace or context argument. Rebind them under `[keys.command]` in
`config.toml`, for example:

```toml
[keys.command]
down = "ctrl-n"
up = "ctrl-p"
accept = ["ctrl-y", "enter"]
```

Each value is one [key combination](plugins.md) or a list of combinations.
It replaces the default set for that action: `["tab", "down"]`,
`["backtab", "up"]`, `["right"]` for `complete`, or `["enter"]`. Include a default in the list to keep it.
An empty list disables the action. Invalid values report errors. Explicit
completion bindings take priority over text editing and cancellation.
To assign `ctrl-c` or `ctrl-e`, first move or disable `quit` or `compact` under
`[keys.global]`.

Legacy `palette_next`, `palette_prev`, and `palette_accept` settings are
automatically migrated to this format, with a `config.toml.bak` backup.
If the file cannot be updated, sofka warns and uses the converted settings in
memory. See [migration](keybindings.md#legacy-palette-migration) for managed
configs, conflicts, and invalid values.

## What suspends the TUI

Interactive actions (`e`, `s` for shell, `a`) suspend the TUI and shell out to
`kubectl`. Delete, scale, restart, set-image, suspend, resume, reconcile, and
port-forward go through the kube API (or a backgrounded process) directly.

If the first PVC listing fails because required tools are missing, sofka tries
other suitable containers, then offers a helper pod. Accept or cancel the
existing confirmation dialog. Volume access restrictions, read-only mode, and
guardrails still apply. Canceling keeps the original error visible.

## Plugin commands

| Command                            | Action                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `:<plugin> [name=value ...]`       | Run a plugin with validated inputs.                          |
| `:plugin-activity`                 | Reopen the active plugin panel or retained report.           |
| `:plugin-cancel`                   | Stop the active plugin run and its temporary forward.        |
| `:sanitize [states=…] [dry_run=…]` | Delete the pods the namespace has finished with (pods view). |

`:sanitize` ships with sofka; see [Sanitize pods](../plugins/sanitize/README.md).

A plugin command started from its key chord or with no arguments opens an input
form when an input has no default, or when the command sets `prompt = "always"`.
Fields start with their default values. In the form:

- `Tab`/`Shift+Tab` or `↓`/`↑` move between fields.
- `←`/`→` cycle a field with `choices` or a `boolean` field.
- `Backspace` removes a character; `Ctrl-U` clears the field.
- `Enter` validates every field and runs the command. Errors appear under the field.
- `Esc` cancels without running anything.

Rebind these keys under `[keys.plugin_form]`.
Popup/report runs open a floating activity panel immediately. In that panel:

- `Ctrl+Alt+T` toggles the popup without cancelling or restarting the job.
- `Esc` hides without cancelling; `:plugin-activity` reopens it.
- After completion, `Ctrl+Alt+T` restores diagnostics; `Enter` opens the report.
- Rebind the toggle with `[keys.global].plugin_activity`.
- `Ctrl+C` cancels the focused run, not sofka. Outside the panel it still quits.
- `↑`/`↓` or `k`/`j`, `PgUp`/`PgDn` scroll; `Home`/`g` goes to the start;
  `End`/`G` resumes following. `←`/`→` or `h`/`l` scroll horizontally.
- `:` hides the panel and opens the command palette.

Installed packages add their commands and key chords to `?` help.
Use `:reload` after a package change.
See [Create a plugin package](plugin-authoring.md).

## Confirmation and input popups

`PgUp` and `PgDn` scroll text that does not fit in the popup. The action keys stay
visible. In an input popup, typing moves the view to the cursor.

## Command failures

A failed interactive command opens an error dialog. `esc` or `enter` dismisses
it; `PgUp` and `PgDn` scroll the output. If a pod shell failed because `sh` is
missing, `d` opens the debug image prompt for the same pod and container.
Accept the image to start the debug container, subject to the configured
guardrails. Canceling the prompt returns to the original error.
